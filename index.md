# Welcome to the St. Olaf Stats and Data Science R Bootcamp

We're so glad you've committed yourself to learning R, which we believe is the most useful, powerful, and flexible statistical software out there! On this page you will find many of the resources used throughout the week. All of the original files can be found directly on the [St. Olaf RStudio server](https://r.stolaf.edu/) in the `Workshop 101 summer21` folder. Those files in their pdf form are listed here, as well as some additonal tip, resources, and learning materials.
